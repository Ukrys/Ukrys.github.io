## 2. Money, Ledgers & Bitcoin

divisibility, scaricity, adoption, ledgers

**Is there inherent value to non-fiat currencies?**
Gold doesn't have any inherent value behind it, and then some forms of currency, like grain, have more. So maybe it's a continuim. And legal tender, like paper currency, also doesn't have inherent value but the govenment makes it the central currency and later forms a social concensus.

**How bitcoin would fit into the history of money?**
First, bitcoin has no inherent value. But it does have some distinguishing values from evan fiat currency that its value is shifting over time with adoption [Arizona voted for accepting bitcoin for taxes but failed in commitee]

**Paper momey came along after metal and non-metal currencies for what reason?**
not enough gold, easy to use
