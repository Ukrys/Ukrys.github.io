## 6. Smart Contracts and DApps

**Smart Contracts:** *Nick Szabo, 1996*

- "A set of promises,
- specified in digital form,
- including protocols
-  within which parties perform on these promises."

However, smart contracts may not be that 'smart' and may not be real 'contracts'. (not AI, more like an API)

**DApps and Token Sales**

- Decentralized Applications (dApps)
  - Applications run on a Decentralized Blockchain Network
  - Generally have a Native Token & Run as a Smart Contract on top of a platform
- Initial Coin Offerings - Crowdfunding for Investment & Consumption 
  - Proceeds used to build networks
  - Tokens usually issued prior to being functional
  - Development, while open source, is largely centralized 
  - Promoters allocate themselves 'premined' tokens
  - Tokens are fungible & transferable
  - Scarcity is fostered with preset 'Monetary policy'
